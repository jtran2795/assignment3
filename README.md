Assignment 3 Milestone 3.2 - Team Guns of Patriots - John Tran, Nelson Safo, Victor Yang

This application was tested on the GDC CS Lab Machines on the basement and 3rd floor.
Milestone Report is in the directory "Milestone Report/".

How to build:
1. In the folder directory, run the command ./buildit
2. Once built, run ./OgreApp
3. Choose Play Online
4. The host must click host game first, then the client can click join game second!
Troubleshooting:
1. If the computers did not connect, close the applications out of both computers and try again.
2. We are using the default NetManager.h/cpp ports so if anyone else is using that port, it probably is interfering.
